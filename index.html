    <h1>Want to find out who you're following but isn't following you back?</h1>
    <h2>You're at the right place.</h2>

    <p>
        Instagram already shows you your <i>followers</i> that you aren't <u>following</u>, but it doesn't do the opposite.
    </p>

    <p>
        I created this site to show you your Insta Ghosts: accounts you're <u>following</u> that 
        aren't your <i>follower</i>. The best part? It's <b>completely anonymous</b>.
    </p>

    <button id="toggleDisclaimer">Why is it so safe?</button>
    <div id="disclaimerContainer">

            It might sound biased since I this is my work, but this is the only website I've found that can prove it's 100% 
            anonymous and safe for you (the site's code for those who want to verify). I wrote this website from scratch, 
            so there's no 3rd parties used here that could steal your information, nor any hacky method of accessing Instagram 
            for account data.
        </p>
        <p>
            This means that by using instaghosts.com, Instagram won't ban you, I won't get sued, and I can't see that you 
            were using instaghosts.com. Most importantly though, this means no hacker or myself can see your IG or your zip 
            file during your entire time here. As soon as you reload/close the tab, the zip file is gone and you have to 
            reupload it if you want to use it again. Sorry for the inconvenience, but at least you're completely safe the 
            entire time you're here.

        <h3>How to Get and Upload Your Zip File</h3>
        <p>
            These steps will guide you through obtaining your Instagram data in a zip file and uploading it here. 
            This process is designed to be <strong>easy and anonymous</strong>—only <strong>you</strong> will have access to your data. 
            If you change your mind at any point, don’t worry—you don’t have to undo anything.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to your Instagram profile page and open <strong>Settings</strong> (☰ menu in the top right).</li>
            <li>Tap <strong>"Accounts Center"</strong>.</li>
            <li>Scroll down and select <strong>"Your information and permissions"</strong>.</li>
            <li>Tap <strong>"Download your information"</strong>, then select <strong>"Download or transfer information"</strong>.</li>
            <li>Choose <strong>"Some of your information"</strong>.</li>
            <li>Scroll down, select <strong>"Followers and following"</strong>, and tap <strong>"Next"</strong>.</li>
            <li>Select <strong>"Download to device"</strong>.</li>
            <li>Tap <strong>"Date range"</strong>, choose <strong>"All time"</strong>, and press <strong>"Save"</strong>.</li>
            <li>Tap <strong>"Create files"</strong>—you’ll receive an email from Instagram when your data is ready.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How to Download and Upload Your Zip File</h3>
        <p>
            Once Instagram gets your zip file ready, follow these steps on an iPhone to download your IG zip file and upload it here. If you don't have an iPhone or they don't line up perfectly, the steps should be very similar and easy to match on your device.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Either wait a few minutes (about <strong>10 minutes at most</strong>) or wait for the email from Instagram confirming your zip file is ready.</li>
            <li>Navigate back to <strong>"Download your information"</strong> (as you did in step 4 above) and click <strong>"Download"</strong> on your file (typically starts with <em>"01/01/04"</em> and ends with <em>"specific information download"</em>).</li>
            <li>Instagram will ask you to <strong>re-enter your password</strong> (on their site, not on instaghosts.com), then click <strong>"Continue"</strong>.</li>
            <li>This will open a new tab in your browser. Download your zip file to <strong>Files</strong> (or any preferred location—this doesn’t necessarily matter). To do this, click "Save...", select Files, then click "Save" and close the tab.</li>
            <li>Go back to <strong>instaghosts.com</strong>, click <strong>"Choose File"</strong>, then select your zip file to upload.</li>
            <li>In case your zip file isn't clearly visible, go to <strong>"On My iPhone"</strong>, your browser name (like <strong>"Chrome"</strong>), and click the zip file with the current date. It should start with "instagram-"</li>
        </ol>
